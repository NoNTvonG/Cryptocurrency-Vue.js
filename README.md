# Cryptocurrency

Hello, this is my recruitment project.<br/>
I using `Vue.js`, `Vuex`, `Vuetify` and API [CoinCap API 2.0](https://docs.coincap.io/).

This is simple project where you can see list crypto coins and you have pagination in order to browse different cryptocurrencies. Also in the header is a search bar where you can searching crypto coins (The entry in the search must be written in this format: `Bitcoin` not `BTC`). Also if you click on the name on the cryptocurrency or on the statistic on the right side, you can see crypto history for selected coin.
